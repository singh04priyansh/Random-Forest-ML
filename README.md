# Random-Forest-ML


Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It belongs to the ensemble learning family, where multiple models are trained to solve the same problem and their predictions are combined for better accuracy and generalization. Here's a brief description of how Random Forest works along with a simple Python code.

How Random Forest Works:->


Bootstrap Sampling: Random Forest starts by creating multiple random samples of the training data set with replacement. These samples are called bootstrap samples.

Decision Trees: For each bootstrap sample, a decision tree is built. Decision trees are constructed based on feature subsets randomly selected at each node of the tree. This helps in reducing overfitting.

Voting: During prediction, each tree in the forest independently predicts the outcome, either a class (for classification) or a value (for regression). In classification tasks, the mode (most frequent) of the predicted classes is taken as the final prediction. In regression tasks, the average of the predicted values is taken.
